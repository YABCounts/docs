# Using our Public API

Ever since [YAB ?! Counts V1.0.2](https://yabcounts.com/blog/v1.0.2), we've had a public API. This allows anyone to fetch data from YAB ?! Counts and use it in their custom coutners, websites, etc.

## Creating an API key

To start creating an API key, first go to [yabcounts.com/api](https://yabcounts.com/api).

![No API keys created](/api/no-api-keys.png)

Click "Create API key" and give your API key a name. The name can be anything, it's only to identify which API key is which.

Once the API key is created, click on the three dots and click "Copy API key" to copy it to your clipboard. **DO NOT SHARE THIS KEY.** This will allow anyone access to the YAB ?! Counts Public API on your behalf.

## Fetching data from the API

You can fetch from the public API directly. Below is an example in JavaScript, which fetches from the [YouTube Channel endpoint](/api/get-a-you-tube-channel).

```js showLineNumbers
// replace "{your api key}" with your API key that you got in the "Creating an API key" chapter
fetch(
  "https://api.yabcounts.com/public/youtube/channel/UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA?key={your api key}"
)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

If you're using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), you can also use our [NPM package](https://github.com/YABCounts/node).

Install it by running:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install yabcounts
```

And then you can fetch from the API like this:

```js showLineNumbers
import { YABCounts } from "yabcounts";
const yabc = new YABCounts("{your api key}");

async function main() {
  console.log(await yabc.youtube.channel("UCX6OQ3DkcsbYNE6H8uQQuVA"));
}

main();
```
